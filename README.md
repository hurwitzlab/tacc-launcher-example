# TACC Launcher Example

To run jobs in parallel on the [Stampede2] 
(https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2) cluster at TACC, 
you must use the [TACC Launcher] (https://github.com/TACC/launcher).

This is an example of how to use the launcher from a bash program. To run:

```
$ sbatch run.sh
```
